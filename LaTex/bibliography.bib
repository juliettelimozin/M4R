abstract = {The estimation of treatment effects on medical costs is complicated by the need to account for informative censoring, skewness, and the effects of confounders. Because medical costs are often collected from observational claims data, we investigate propensity score (PS) methods such as covariate adjustment, stratification, and inverse probability weighting taking into account informative censoring of the cost outcome. We compare these more commonly used methods with doubly robust (DR) estimation. We then use a machine learning approach called super learner (SL) to choose among conventional cost models to estimate regression parameters in the DR approach and to choose among various model specifications for PS estimation. Our simulation studies show that when the PS model is correctly specified, weighting and DR perform well. When the PS model is misspecified, the combined approach of DR with SL can still provide unbiased estimates. SL is especially useful when the underlying cost distribution comes from a mixture of different distributions or when the true PS model is unknown. We apply these approaches to a cost analysis of two bladder cancer treatments, cystectomy versus bladder preservation therapy, using SEER-Medicare data. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

When observations are censored, the outcomes are only partially observed and standard deep learning algorithms cannot be directly applied. We develop a new class of deep learning algorithms for outcomes that are potentially censored. To account for censoring, the unobservable loss function used in the absence of censoring is replaced by a censoring unbiased transformation. The resulting class of algorithms can be used to estimate both survival probabilities and restricted mean survival. We show how the deep learning algorithms can be implemented by adapting software for uncensored data by using a form of response transformation. We provide comparisons of the proposed deep learning algorithms to existing risk prediction algorithms for predicting survival probabilities and restricted mean survival through both simulated datasets and analysis of data from breast cancer patients.},

abstract = {Epidemiologic research often aims to estimate the association between a binary exposure and a binary outcome, while adjusting for a set of covariates (eg, confounders). When data are clustered, as in, for instance, matched case-control studies and co-twin-control studies, it is common to use conditional logistic regression. In this model, all cluster-constant covariates are absorbed into a cluster-specific intercept, whereas cluster-varying covariates are adjusted for by explicitly adding these as explanatory variables to the model. In this paper, we propose a doubly robust estimator of the exposure-outcome odds ratio in conditional logistic regression models. This estimator protects against bias in the odds ratio estimator due to misspecification of the part of the model that contains the cluster-varying covariates. The doubly robust estimator uses two conditional logistic regression models for the odds ratio, one prospective and one retrospective, and is consistent for the exposure-outcome odds ratio if at least one of these models is correctly specified, not necessarily both. We demonstrate the properties of the proposed method by simulations and by re-analyzing a publicly available dataset from a matched case-control study on induced abortion and infertility.},

abstract = {Summary The goal of this article is to construct doubly robust (DR) estimators in ignorable missing data and causal inference models. In a missing data model, an estimator is DR if it remains consistent when either (but not necessarily both) a model for the missingness mechanism or a model for the distribution of the complete data is correctly specified. Because with observational data one can never be sure that either a missingness model or a complete data model is correct, perhaps the best that can be hoped for is to find a DR estimator. DR estimators, in contrast to standard likelihood-based or (nonaugmented) inverse probability-weighted estimators, give the analyst two chances, instead of only one, to make a valid inference. In a causal inference model, an estimator is DR if it remains consistent when either a model for the treatment assignment mechanism or a model for the distribution of the counterfactual data is correctly specified. Because with observational data one can never be sure that a model for the treatment assignment mechanism or a model for the counterfactual data is correct, inference based on DR estimators should improve upon previous approaches. Indeed, we present the results of simulation studies which demonstrate that the finite sample performance of DR estimators is as impressive as theory would predict. The proposed method is applied to a cardiovascular clinical trial.},

Studies have shown that the doubly robust estimator is subject to more bias than the standard weighting estimator when both PS and outcome models are incorrectly specified. Method We evaluated whether various machine learning methods can be used for estimating conditional means of the potential outcomes to enhance the robustness of the doubly robust estimator to various degrees of model misspecification in terms of reducing bias and standard error. We considered four types of methods to predict the outcomes: least squares, tree-based methods, generalized additive models and shrinkage methods. We also considered an ensemble method called the Super Learner (SL), which is a linear combination of multiple learners. We conducted simulations considering different scenarios by the complexity of PS and outcome-generating models and some ranges of treatment prevalence. Results The shrinkage methods performed well with robust doubly robust estimates in term of bias and mean squared error across the scenarios when the models became rich by including all 2-way interactions of the covariates. The SL performed similarly to the best method in each scenario. Conclusions Our findings indicate that machine learning methods such as the SL or the shrinkage methods using interaction models should be used for more accurate doubly robust estimators.},

abstract = {Summary In statistical inference, one has to make sure that the underlying regression model is correctly specified otherwise the resulting estimation may be biased. Model checking is an important method to detect any departure of the regression model from the true one. Missing data are a ubiquitous problem in social and medical studies. If the underlying regression model is correctly specified, recent researches show great popularity of the doubly robust (DR) estimates method for handling missing data because of its robustness to the misspecification of either the missing data model or the conditional mean model, that is, the model for the conditional expectation of true regression model conditioning on the observed quantities. However, little work has been devoted to the goodness of fit test for DR estimates method. In this article, we propose a testing method to assess the reliability of the estimator derived from the DR estimating equation with possibly missing response and always observed auxiliary variables. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed test can control type I errors well. Furthermore the proposed method can detect departures from model assumptions in the marginal mean model of interest powerfully. A real dementia data set is used to illustrate the method for the diagnosis of model misspecification in the problem of missing response with an always observed auxiliary variable for cross-sectional data.},

abstract = {Interference occurs when the treatment (or exposure) of one individual affects the outcomes of others. In some settings, it may be reasonable to assume that individuals can be partitioned into clusters such that there is no interference between individuals in different clusters, that is, there is partial interference. In observational studies with partial interference, inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators have been something else different possible treatment effects. However, the validity of IPW estimators depends on the propensity score being known or correctly modelled. Alternatively, one can estimate the treatment effect using an outcome regression model. In this paper, we propose doubly robust (DR) estimators that utilize both models and are consistent and asymptotically normal if either model, but not necessarily both, is correctly specified. Empirical results are presented to demonstrate the DR property of the proposed estimators and the efficiency gain of DR over IPW estimators when both models are correctly specified. The different estimators are illustrated using data from a study examining the effects of cholera vaccination in Bangladesh.},

abstract = {The weighted average treatment effect is a causal measure for the comparison of interventions in a specific target population, which may be different from the population where data are sampled from. For instance, when the goal is to introduce a new treatment to a target population, the question is what efficacy (or effectiveness) can be gained by switching patients from a standard of care (control) to this new treatment, for which the average treatment effect for the control estimand can be applied. In this paper, we propose two estimators based on augmented inverse probability weighting to estimate the weighted average treatment effect for a well-defined target population (ie, there exists a predefined target function of covariates that characterizes the population of interest, for example, a function of age to focus on elderly diabetic patients using samples from the US population). The first proposed estimator is doubly robust if the target function is known or can be correctly specified. The second proposed estimator is doubly robust if the target function has a linear dependence on the propensity score, which can be used to estimate the average treatment effect for the treated and the average treatment effect for the control. We demonstrate the properties of the proposed estimators through theoretical proof and simulation studies. We also apply our proposed methods in a comparison of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists therapy and insulin therapy among patients with type 2 diabetes, using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink data.},

abstract = {Abstract Background In propensity score modeling, it is a standard practice to optimize the prediction of exposure status based on the covariate information. In a simulation study, we examined in what situations analyses based on various types of exposure propensity score (EPS) models using data mining techniques such as recursive partitioning (RP) and neural networks (NN) produce unbiased and/or efficient results. Method We simulated data for a hypothetical cohort study (n = 2000) with a binary exposure/outcome and 10 binary/continuous covariates with seven scenarios differing by non-linear and/or non-additive associations between exposure and covariates. EPS models used logistic regression (LR) (all possible main effects), RP1 (without pruning), RP2 (with pruning), and NN. We calculated c-statistics (C), standard errors (SE), and bias of exposure-effect estimates from outcome models for the PS-matched dataset. Results Data mining techniques yielded higher C than LR (mean: NN, 0.86; RPI, 0.79; RP2, 0.72; and LR, 0.76). SE tended to be greater in models with higher C. Overall bias was small for each strategy, although NN estimates tended to be the least biased. C was not correlated with the magnitude of bias (correlation coefficient [COR] = −0.3, p = 0.1) but increased SE (COR = 0.7, p < 0.001). Conclusions Effect estimates from EPS models by simple LR were generally robust. NN models generally provided the least numerically biased estimates. C was not associated with the magnitude of bias but was with the increased SE. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
